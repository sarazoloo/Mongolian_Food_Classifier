# Mongolian Food Classifier

#### This is a simple app created for LETU Mongolia's Deep Learning class. 
There are four categories of classification:
- Khuushuur
- Tsuivan
- Niislel Salad
- Buuz

### How it works
You upload a file that either has a jpeg, jpg, or a png type. It then uses the trained model used with fastai. 
Your result will appear in the bottom with the confidence level.
